## [0.5.3]

### Fixed

- Rust 1.95 clippy in `ast.rs`: removed four `cmd.wrappers.into_iter()` calls inside `Extend::extend` (the trait already takes any `IntoIterator`), and rewrote one `loop { let Some(...) = ... else { break; }; ... }` as `while let Some(...) = ... { ... }`. Pre-existing on 1.94 too — surfaced once CI cargo bumped to 1.95.
- Suggest CLI test: `sort_by` rewritten as `sort_by_key` with `Reverse` (clippy `unnecessary_sort_by`).
- Release workflow: explicit `echo "$HOME/.cargo/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH` step after `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`. On the macos-latest runner image the pre-installed `cargo` is a `rustup-init` shim that, with no default toolchain, won races against the just-installed rustup cargo — `cargo build --target …` died with `unexpected argument 'build' found` in 0.5.1 and 0.5.2 release attempts. Prepending the rustup cargo dir to PATH explicitly is the fix.

### Compatibility

- 0.5.1 and 0.5.2 were never published as GitHub releases (release workflow failed before `softprops/action-gh-release` ran). The Docker image `ghcr.io/diana-random1st/secguard:0.5.2` exists but no tar.gz binaries or installer assets. Install 0.5.3 instead.

## [0.5.2]

### Fixed

- Workspace `Cargo.toml` accidentally included `crates/secguard-mcp` (an unfinished, untracked crate) in members during the 0.5.1 commit. CI and the release build failed to load the missing manifest. 0.5.2 removes the reference — no functional change. 0.5.1 should not be installed; use 0.5.2 instead.

## [0.5.1]

### Fixed

- `policy.rs`: replaced manual `cmd["prefix ".len()..]` indexing with `strip_prefix` on the `terraform` and `brew` branches. Behaviour is identical for valid input but the original code could panic at runtime on an unfortunate byte slice; the new code returns `None` and falls through.
- `ast.rs`: two `herestring_redirect` loops that immediately `break` are now plain `.next()` calls with an explicit `children` binding to keep the iterator alive long enough. Pre-existing; surfaced when CI clippy went green for the first time.

### Added

- End-to-end integration tests through the binary for the 0.5 features:
  - `strict_block = false` resolved from a config file (no env var) restores the JSON `ask` path.
  - `safe_command_prefixes` in config makes a non-built-in command (`rclone copy …`) policy-safe.
  - `secguard guard suggest` against a synthetic telemetry file: brain-only filter, min-count gate, prefix grouping, TOML stub emission.
  - Shadow mode parity coverage for Codex and Gemini targets (was Claude-only).

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **Strict block mode** for the Claude Code target. The hook now exits with code `2` on destructive verdicts instead of emitting a JSON `ask` response. Reason: Claude's `bypassPermissions` mode ignores hook JSON decisions but honours `exit(2)`, so the old behaviour left secguard toothless in accept-all mode. Toggle off with `strict_block = false` in `~/.config/secguard/config.toml` or `SECGUARD_STRICT=0` per-invocation. Codex and Gemini targets are unaffected.
- **User config file** at `~/.config/secguard/config.toml` (override path via `SECGUARD_CONFIG`). Recognised fields: `safe_kill_targets`, `safe_command_prefixes`, `strict_block`. Parse errors fall back to defaults with a stderr warning; never panics.
- **`secguard guard suggest`** subcommand. Reads `~/.secguard/telemetry.jsonl`, picks brain-only `destructive` verdicts (the false-positive candidates the deterministic rules didn't catch), groups by command prefix, prints the top-N with a paste-ready `safe_command_prefixes = [...]` block. Flags: `--top N` (default 20), `--min-count N` (default 3).

### Changed

- **Wider built-in policy allowlist** in `policy.rs`. Newly covered safe-by-policy commands:
  - `gws ` (Google Workspace CLI) — all subcommands.
  - `diana ` — all subcommands except those containing `rm `/`delete`.
  - `psql ` and `psql -` (DB client connections).
  - `terraform` read-only subcommands: `plan`, `show`, `output`, `validate`, `state list`, `state show`, `fmt`, `version`. Mutating subcommands (`apply`, `destroy`, `taint`, `import`) stay subject to heuristic + brain phases.
  - `brew` non-destructive subcommands: `install`, `upgrade`, `list`, `info`, `search`, `update`, `outdated`, `tap`, `leaves`. `uninstall` and `cleanup` are excluded.
  - Package-manager read/build/install subcommands for `cargo`, `npm`, `bun`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `pip`, `uv`: `build`, `check`, `test`, `install`, `ci`, `add`, `sync`, `run`, `list`, `show`, `info`, `search`, `version`, `--help`. Destructive subcommands (`clean`, `uninstall`) are excluded.

### Compatibility

- Existing `~/.config/secguard/config.toml` files without `strict_block` get the new default (`true`). To preserve pre-0.5 UX explicitly, add `strict_block = false`.
- No changes to the destructive-verdict criteria — strict mode only changes *how* the block is delivered to Claude Code, not *what* is blocked.
